  AssemblyLift is an open source platform that gives you a fast & ergonomic way to build cloud-native services on a predictable, 
secure, and portable runtime -- from the edge to the cloud -- powered by WebAssembly.

# The What and Why of AssemblyLift

**AssemblyLift wants to take the complexity out of building cloud-native applications.**  

Microservice architecture & containers bring a number of benefits including greater scalability, high fault-tolerance, 
and faster deployment. 'Serverless' microservices and functions offer scale-to-zero and per-millisecond billing, with 
implied economic benefits, without having to manage any kind of server. [An explosion of managed cloud services & APIs](https://landscape.cncf.io/) 
give developers more options than ever to delegate to a third party.

The problem with all of this is that there is now a large number of _things_ -- microservices, functions, data services & APIs, etc. 
-- which all need to communicate and move data across all kinds of boundaries. The high surface area this creates becomes 
visible when you use infrastructure-as-code; it can take a large number of virtual cloud resources just to deploy a "simple"
microservice or FaaS function in a typical production environment.

AssemblyLift provides an opinionated platform for building function-oriented microservices. Cloud-native architecture is occasionally [1,2]
referred to as "Lego brick" or "building block" architecture, due to the way nearly any subset of services can fit together to create 
a stack suitable for your application.
