![AssemblyLift CI](https://github.com/akkoro/assemblylift/workflows/AssemblyLift%20CI/badge.svg)

AssemblyLift is a framework for building serverless applications with WebAssembly (WASM).

Highlight reel:

- ["IO Modules"](backends/aws-lambda/iomod) (eventually to be shipped as packages/plugins) provide an interface for both the host and WASM guest,
  allowing guests to **safely** make calls to the outside world without needing elevated access.
- Currently focusing on support for guests written in **Rust**, but other languages targeting WASM are possible. PR's welcome!
- IOmods are **asynchronous** (using [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)), and guests written using Rust fully support **async/await**.
- Planned support for multiple backends, but the focus is currently on _AWS Lambda_
- Built using the [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io) interpreter

**Examples** can be found [here](/examples).

# Overview

The three primary aims of this project, are to provide you with an _ergonomic_ development framework for building serverless applications
which are both _efficient_, and _safe_.

## Efficiency

WebAssembly modules [are smaller and faster](https://medium.com/@OPTASY.com/webassembly-vs-javascript-is-wasm-faster-than-js-when-does-javascript-perform-better-db86d2ecf2cc)
than their NodeJS counterparts. Combined with the IOmod framework, most of the heavy lifting (such as a call to an AWS
service) is handled by the host runtime (which is native code, written in Rust).

## Safety

WebAssembly modules are isolated -- they are sandboxed with their own memory, and have no access to the outside world
(such as by opening a socket connection). This allows your serverless guest code to be _untrusted_.

A side-effect of this with respect to an IOmod, is that the guest code has to ask the host to execute
any third-party dependency code which needs network access. Ideally this will help you prevent unwanted version changes that
have a habit of sneaking into function code, keeping your entire project in sync and giving you tighter control over
your dependency supply chain.

## Ergonomics

It's still early days, so there's nothing in this repo right now which I would characterize as ergonomic. In terms of
plans in this area, I intend for the tooling to abstract away as much of the underlying backend as possible (ie AWS vs Azure).

# Building

To build using your local Cargo installation, run  
`./build.rb build local {optional Cargo build args}`

To generate a build of `bootstrap` to deploy to AWS Lambda, run  
`./build.rb build deploy (optional Cargo build args}`

If using Ruby as a build front-end is problematic in your environment, please [file an issue](https://github.com/akkoro/assemblylift/issues/new?labels=bug)!

# Contributing

I'd like to figure this part out collaboratively. Just in terms of getting code merged though,
I'm a big fan of [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow),
so let's start there ðŸ™‚.
